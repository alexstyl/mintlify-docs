# How to build a menu mobile app for your restaurant in less than 10 minutes

In this quick tutorial you will learn how to build a native iOS and Android menu app for your restaurant. No coding or headaches involved.

## Step #1 – Create a new app using the Restaurant Menu Template

Paper allows you to build apps from scratch and customize them visually, but we are going to fast track things by using an app template. Templates come with a lot of work already done, which you can customize as you like.

Select the [Restaurant Menu Template](/app?app_template=restaurant-menu&preview=true) and click `Select` on the top right to start a new app using this template.

## Step #2 – Link your restaurant menu to your app

Click the <img class='button-secondary p-1 m-0  inline' src="/assets/data.svg"> Data button on the top right, to bring in the [Data Panel](/docs/building/data).

This is where we tell Paper where to get your restaurant's menu from.

Notice how there is already a link to a Google Sheet prefilled, coming from the app template we used.

[Make a copy of that Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GBXeH_e5Y6dFyfvBJKG01HLF3RoI8r-6Vv2vH7y3Eh8/edit?gid=1292633441#gid=1292633441) and update the contents with your own event's agenda.

Make sure your Sheet is publicly available to everyone. [Learn how by clicking here](/docs/building/data)

Then replace the link of your Google Sheet we created in Step 1 and press `Refresh`.

## Step #3 – Update the About screen of your app and Preview your app

At this point you have a functioning agenda app for your event. To try out your app press `Play`

The product catalog template contains an `About` screen with information about your business.

Select the `About` screen from the left side of the screen and update the text about your business by clicking on it twice.

Optionally, you can customize any screen you want, anyway you like. Paper's interactive drag and drop editor allows you to change anything visually.

When you are happy with your changes, click `Play` to see how your app will look like on your customers' phones.

## Step #4: Give your app a name, an icon and a name space

Your app is ready, and it's time to publish it to the app stores.

Click on the `App Settings` and give your app a name, icon and `App Namespace`. The app namespace is a unique identifier for your app. A common way to do this is to reverse your website's domain (if have one).

For example if your website is `mywebsite.com` then the app name space is usually `com.mywebsite`.

Also upload an icon for your event app and click Save.

## Step #5: Publish to the App Stores

When you are done, click the `Publish` Button on the top right. Choose the stores you want to publish on and hit 'Publish'.

Done! Your app is now getting ready for the app store.

We will notify you once it is ready along with the final instructions.

We wish you best of luck with your event!

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I update my restaurant's menu?
Changing the menu in your restaurant app is as simple as changing the data in your Google Sheet. You can freely add or delete new dishes, update prices and so at any time. Your customers will see the new changes when they navigate to the respective screen. This is instant, no need to Publish your changes or wait for another app store review.

### How do I update my app's looks?
Do any visual changes you need in your app via our intuitive drag and drop designer. When you are happy with your changes, click on the `Publish` button and you changes will be sent off to the market. Your app might be subject of review, so we recommend keeping Publishing to a minimum unless necessary.

### What are the fees involved of publishing my event agenda app?
Paper is free to get started, and [publishing requires a paid subscription](/pricing).

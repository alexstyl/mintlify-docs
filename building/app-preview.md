# Previewing your app

You can preview how your app will look and behave like at any point with the click of the Play button.

This is great for **fast iterations** as it you do not need to install your app on a real device which is a painfully slow
process.

To preview a functioning version of your app, click on the Play Button.

Here you can click and scroll as you normally would in an installed app.

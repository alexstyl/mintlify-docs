# Display data from Google Sheets in your mobile apps

Paper uses Google Sheets to display dynamic content in your apps.

## How to link your Google Sheet with your mobile app


Click the <img class='button-secondary p-1 m-0  inline' src="/assets/data.svg"> Data button on the top right, to bring in the [Data Panel](/docs/building/data).

This is where we tell Paper where to load content from.

Paste the URL of the Google Sheet Document you would like to use and click 'Set'.
 
If your Sheet Document contains multiple sheets, you will have the option to select which one to use.

Paper works with both Public and Private Sheets. However, for private sheets, make sure to invite Paper as a Viewer into your sheet by sending an invitation to: `paper-server@paper-437704.iam.gserviceaccount.com`

## How to display content from Google Sheets in your mobile app

Use either a [List](/docs/components/list) & or a [Grid](/docs/components/grid) component and select your linked Google Sheet as a Data Source.

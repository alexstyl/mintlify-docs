# Tablet Overrides (responsive design)

Tablet overrides are special properties that are only applied when a specific component is displayed on Tablets.

<video class="rounded-xl object-cover border w-full" autoplay loop muted playsinline controls>
    <source src="/assets/responsive.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source>
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>


This is what enables your app to look great on both Phones and Tablets.

Here is an example of making a [Stack](/components/stack) be horizontal while on Tablets, while remain
vertical on Phones.

## 1. Select the element you want to customize on Tablets

You can do so either in the [Screen Canvas](/building#screen-canvas) or the [Layers Panel](/building#layers-panel)

## 3.Change the property you want to update on Tablets

For our example, we changed the **Orientation** property to be **Horizontal**

That's all. The override will only be applied on tablets.

# Get started

Here is the fastest way to build modern looking apps in no time using Paper:

## Change your app's branding with Themes

Click the <img class='button-secondary p-1 m-0 inline' src="/assets/themes.svg"></img> button to bring up the Theme Panel.

Here you can change the look and feel of your app. All components such as Cards' and Buttons' looks will be updated automatically across your app.

The most important properties you need to know about are:

- Primary Color
- On Primary Color
- Surface Color
- On Surface Color
- Background Color
- On Background Color

<div class="rounded p-4 card bg-green-100">You can always style every single element in your app independently of your theme</div>

## Customize everything visually

Tap on any component in your screen's layout to modify it. The **Properties Panel** will pop up.

Here you can customize anything in the selected component, from background colors, to the content (such as text and icons) and so on.

## Export your code with one click

When you‚Äôre done, click the <span class='button-primary m-0 p-1'>Export</span> button to get the full source code of your app.
You can then import it directly on Android Studio or IntelliJ IDEA.

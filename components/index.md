Screens in Paper consist of **Components**. You can think of Components like building blocks.

There are simple Components such as [Text](/components/text) and [Image](/components/image) that display a
simple piece of information.

A [Stack](/components/stack) can hold multiple components.

You can build richer components by combining multiple components together.

## Styling your components with Properties

Every component in a screen a series of properties that can be defined.
